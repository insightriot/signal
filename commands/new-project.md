# Initialize New Signal Project

You are starting a new project using the Signal workflow. This command sets up the project foundation and transitions into Phase 0 (CALIBRATE).

## Steps

### 0. `.gitignore` check (run before writing anything)

Signal's architecture requires `.planning/` to be tracked in git — it's the project's memory, not scratch state. Before creating the directory, search the repo-root `.gitignore` (and any nested `.gitignore` above the working directory) for lines that would ignore `.planning/` (e.g., `.planning`, `.planning/`, `/.planning/`, `**/.planning/`).

- **If found:** halt before any writes. Tell the user that `.planning/` must be tracked, explain why (project's institutional memory — state, decisions log, context, plans, verification reports — is lost on clone if ignored), and offer to remove the offending line. Do not proceed until the user confirms removal or explicitly overrides (and log the override in `STATE.md`'s body).
- **If clean:** proceed silently.

This check is non-negotiable. The same rule applies in `/sig:calibrate` for the same reason — both are entry-point commands; downstream phases assume `.planning/` is committed.

### 1. Create Project State

Create the `.planning/` directory in the current working directory with:
- `STATE.md` — tracks current phase, completed phases, and blockers
- `config.json` — copy from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/state/config.json`
- `PROJECT.md` — to be populated during DISCUSS

Initialize `STATE.md` with:
```markdown
# Project State

## Current Phase
CALIBRATE

## Completed Phases
(none)

## Blockers
(none)

## Last Updated
{current_date}
```

### 1b. Epic mode (`--epic <name>`, optional)

If invoked with `--epic <name>` (M4.5.E11), open the project's first Epic right after STATE init so `current_epic` is set automatically and downstream artifacts are Epic-scoped. Resolve the ID exactly as `/sig:discuss` § "Epic mode" describes: a strict `M{N}.E{K}` value is used verbatim; otherwise derive with `deriveNextEpicId(baseDir, { milestone })` (a brand-new project has no prior Epic, so pass the milestone explicitly) and call `setCurrentEpic(baseDir, resolvedId)` (`tools/lib/state.js`). Without `--epic`, the project starts in linear mode (byte-identical to pre-E11).

### 2. Gather Project Context

Ask the user:
1. What are you building? (one paragraph)
2. What's the target audience?
3. Are there existing codebases or repos to integrate with?
4. What are the hard constraints? (language, framework, deployment, timeline)
5. What does "done" look like?

### 3. Generate PROJECT.md

From the answers, generate `.planning/PROJECT.md` following the format in the plugin's `PROJECT.md` as a reference — include Vision, Problem Statement, Success Criteria, Scope (in/out), Constraints, and Done When.

### 4. Transition to CALIBRATE

Update `STATE.md` to reflect CALIBRATE phase is active. Inform the user they can now run `/sig:calibrate` to tier the project (SKETCH / FEATURE / SPIKE / FULL) before entering structured phases.

## Gate: Project Initialized
- [ ] `.gitignore` does not ignore `.planning/`
- [ ] `.planning/` directory created
- [ ] `STATE.md` initialized
- [ ] `PROJECT.md` captures user's intent
- [ ] User understands Phase 0 + six-phase workflow ahead
