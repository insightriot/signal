# PLAN Phase

You are running the PLAN phase of the Signal workflow. Your goal: produce an executable plan that any agent can follow without further clarification.

## 0. Tier-gating preamble (run before anything else)

Read `.planning/PROFILE.md` before any other workflow step.

- **If `PROFILE.md` is missing:** halt with *"No PROFILE.md found at .planning/PROFILE.md. Run `/sig:calibrate` first to tier this project, then re-run `/sig:plan`."* Do not proceed.
- **If `PLAN` is in `phases_skipped`:** exit with *"This tier ({tier}) skips PLAN. Run `/sig:execute` next, or `/sig:escalate` if scope has grown and PLAN should run."* Do not proceed. (No v1 tier currently skips PLAN; this guard is defensive.)
- **Apply `rigor_overrides`** from PROFILE.md:

| Override | Effect on this phase |
|---|---|
| `research_parallelism: 0` | Skip Step 2 (Research) entirely. |
| `research_parallelism: 2` | Spawn 2 research agents instead of 4 (pick the most relevant — usually domain + codebase). |
| `research_parallelism: 4` | Full 4-agent research (domain, codebase, risk, prior art). |
| `plan_validation_dims: none` | Skip Step 4 (Plan Validation) entirely. |
| `plan_validation_dims: core` | Run only 3 dimensions: goal alignment, completeness, testability. |
| `plan_validation_dims: all` | Run all 8 dimensions. |
| `nyquist_enforcement: off` | Skip Step 5 (Nyquist mapping). |
| `nyquist_enforcement: basic` or `strict` | Run Step 5. (Strictness — proof-of-fail-before-pass — is enforced in VERIFY, not here.) |
| `gate_strictness: off` | Auto-advance through plan approval; no user confirmation required. |
| `gate_strictness: light` | Confirm at end of phase (default). |
| `gate_strictness: strict` | Confirm at every step + run anti-rationalization check at the gate. |

Tooling: `tools/lib/profile.js` exposes `readProfile`, `isPhaseEnabled`, `applyRigorOverrides`. Schema reference: `references/profile-schema.md`. Question convention: `references/question-patterns.md`.

## Skill Loading

Load these skills (paths shown — bound to PLAN regardless of which directory the SKILL.md file lives in):
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plan/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/build/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md` (cross-bound: lives in `build/`, used in PLAN for designing contracts before code is written)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ship/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md` (cross-bound: lives in `ship/`, used in PLAN for deprecation planning at design time; also loaded in SHIP for cleanup)

## Workflow

### 1. Load Context

Read from `.planning/`:
- `PROJECT.md`, `PROFILE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `STATE.md` — verify current phase is PLAN

### 1b. Drain FUTURE-IDEAS.md (advisory — promote captured ideas into this plan)

`/sig:add` captures ideas to `.planning/FUTURE-IDEAS.md` between planning passes; PLAN is where they get dispositioned, so captures don't rot in a write-only file. This step is **advisory and fully skippable** — if you'd rather not triage now, skip the whole step and planning proceeds unchanged.

Load candidates with `listDrainCandidatesWithRecovery(content)` from `tools/lib/drain.js`. It reads `.planning/FUTURE-IDEAS.md` and returns `{candidates, danglingFence, recoveredCount}`: `candidates` is every top-level `## ` entry that is **not** already dispositioned (no date window, so the first run surfaces the whole standing backlog by design), plus any entries a **dangling (unclosed) code fence** had swallowed. If `danglingFence` is true, **announce** it before listing candidates — e.g. `⚠ FUTURE-IDEAS.md has an unclosed code fence; recovered {recoveredCount} otherwise-hidden entr(y/ies). Fix the fence when convenient.` — so a malformed fenced sample can't silently drop captured ideas. (`listDrainCandidates` remains the bare-return primitive for callers that don't need the recovery signal.)

**Recovered entries are read-only-visible, NOT dispositionable.** A candidate carrying `recovered: true` was resurfaced from below the dangling fence; it has a valid `range` but **no `entryIndex` in `parseEntries(content)`** (the fence swallowed it), so `applyDisposition`/`applyDispositions` cannot target it. **List recovered entries for awareness but do NOT offer promote/defer/merge/delete on them, and exclude them from the "defer all remaining" batch.** The only correct action is: fix the unclosed fence, then re-run the drain — they become normal, dispositionable entries. Disposition acts only on the non-`recovered` candidates.

- **No candidates** → emit the one-line note `(no FUTURE-IDEAS candidates to drain)` and continue to Step 2.
- **Candidates present** → render them **compactly** — heading + the one-line Status, numbered (recovered entries flagged and un-numbered / not selectable). On a large first run, offer **"defer all remaining"** up front (a single `applyDispositions` batch over the **non-recovered** candidates only) so the user can clear the wall in one action instead of N prompts.

For each entry the user keeps triaging, offer a `strict-enum [promote, defer, merge, delete]` choice plus an explicit **skip** (leave the entry untouched and move on):

| Verb | Effect |
|---|---|
| **promote** | Fold the idea into this plan as a candidate task (feeds Step 3). Stamps the entry's Status inline — `→ Promoted {date} ({Epic} drain).` — so the entry stays in FUTURE-IDEAS, marked done, and never resurfaces on a later drain. |
| **defer** | Leave it for a later pass. Stamps `→ Deferred {date} ({Epic} drain).`. |
| **merge** | The idea folds into another entry; the source block is **removed**. |
| **delete** | Drop the idea entirely; the block is **removed**. |
| **skip** | No change; the entry stays a candidate for the next drain. |

**R1 — HARD GATE: preview the diff before any disposition write.** A drain write mutates the project's idea database, so — unlike `/sig:add`'s instant-capture hot path — every write is **previewed first**. Compute the proposed content with `applyDisposition` (or `applyDispositions` for the batch), show the user a diff of exactly what will change, and write **only after they accept**. Never persist a disposition the user hasn't seen. The write itself goes through `applyDispositionToFile` (one full-file `atomicWrite` per disposition, reusing the `/sig:add` substrate).

**delete / merge confirm (R5 sub-gate).** Because they remove text, `delete` and `merge` require a per-entry `strict-enum [confirm, keep]` confirmation **regardless of `gate_strictness`** — `keep` leaves the file byte-for-byte unchanged. The removal reason is recorded in the eventual commit message, not in the file.

**promote** entries flow into Step 3 (Create Plan) as candidate tasks. This step never blocks planning: skip it, batch-defer it, or triage entry-by-entry — all three leave you ready for Step 2.

### 2. Research (Parallel Agents)

Spawn up to 4 research agents in parallel:
- **Domain researcher** — external docs, libraries, APIs relevant to this phase
- **Codebase researcher** — existing patterns, reusable code, integration points
- **Risk researcher** — what could go wrong, edge cases, known pitfalls
- **Prior art researcher** — how similar problems have been solved

Synthesize research into `.planning/{phase}-RESEARCH.md`.

### 3. Create Plan

Generate `.planning/{phase}-PLAN.md` with:
- Phase goal (one sentence)
- Tasks broken into vertical slices (each slice is independently shippable)
- Dependencies between tasks
- Acceptance criteria per task
- Test strategy per task (TDD where applicable)
- Estimated complexity (S/M/L — not time)

### 4. Plan Validation (8 Dimensions)

Validate the plan against:
1. **Goal alignment** — does every task serve the phase goal?
2. **Completeness** — are all requirements covered?
3. **Dependency correctness** — are dependencies accurate and minimal?
4. **Testability** — can every task be verified?
5. **Scope discipline** — no gold-plating or scope creep?
6. **Context feasibility** — can each task fit in a single agent context?
7. **Risk coverage** — are identified risks mitigated?
8. **Vertical slicing** — is each task a full slice, not a horizontal layer?

### 5. Nyquist Test-Coverage Mapping

For each task, map the acceptance criteria to specific test types:
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for boundaries
- E2E tests for user flows

Write to `.planning/{phase}-VALIDATION.md`.

### 6. Environment check (final gate before EXECUTE)

PLAN's research happens against assumed runtimes (e.g., "Node 22 + better-sqlite3 v11 prebuilts"). EXECUTE happens against the actual dev machine. Drift between the two — different Node major, missing prebuilt binary, OS-specific compiler toolchain — is a common, expected friction that's cheaper to surface here than at first `npm install`.

For each runtime / native dep / external service identified during research:

- [ ] Note the assumed runtime version in `{phase}-PLAN.md` (e.g., "Node 22+ assumed; tested on Node 22.x").
- [ ] If the project has a package manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.), do a dry-run of the install (`npm install --dry-run`, `cargo check`, etc.) to confirm dependency resolution works on the dev runtime.
- [ ] If a native module is involved, confirm a prebuilt binary exists for the dev runtime — or budget time for source-build dependencies (Xcode CLT, build-essential, etc.) in EXECUTE Slice 1.
- [ ] If research named specific package versions, confirm they are still on the registry and not yanked.

Document any drift discovered (e.g., "research assumed `better-sqlite3@11`; dev machine on Node 25 needs `@12+`") in `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` as an addendum, then either update the plan or budget Slice 1 to handle the version bump.

This step is intentionally lightweight at FEATURE/SKETCH (`research_parallelism: 0–2`); it's primarily a guard against silent assumption drift at FULL where 4-agent research can produce confident-but-stale environment claims.

### 7. Mark STATE.md fresh (M4.5.E10.S1.t5, FR3)

**SKETCH tier:** skip this step. STATE.md updates only via manual `/sig:checkpoint`.

**FEATURE/SPIKE/FULL:** after the PLAN artifacts (`{phase}-PLAN.md` / `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` / `{phase}-VALIDATION.md`) are committed, call `markFresh(baseDir, {commit: <git HEAD>})` from `tools/lib/state.js`. This advances `last_updated` + `last_updated_commit` to the phase-close commit so the staleness banner in `/sig:resume` reads fresh after PLAN. Run it **after** the commit — passing a pre-commit HEAD records a stale sha and silently defeats the freshness check (AC3.4).

Wrap the call in a **catch-all**: if `markFresh` throws for *any* reason — `StateSchemaError` on a schema-mismatched STATE.md, `StateWriteError` on lock contention, git unavailable — warn and continue. The plan is written and committed; a state-write blip is a recovery item, not a PLAN failure. (Mirrors verify/review/ship; a bare git/lock guard is not enough — `markFresh` can throw `StateSchemaError` too.)

## Phase Gate

### Anti-Rationalization Check
| Temptation | Check |
|---|---|
| "The plan is in my head, I don't need to write it down" | File-based plans are what make agents durable across sessions |
| "This task is too small to need acceptance criteria" | If it doesn't have criteria, how will you know it's done? |
| "We can figure out the test strategy during execution" | TDD requires knowing what to test before writing code |
| "Vertical slicing is overkill for this" | Horizontal slicing creates integration debt |
| "The plan's decided — skip the FUTURE-IDEAS drain" | No. FUTURE-IDEAS is `/sig:add`'s default destination; the PLAN drain (Step 1b) IS the promotion step. Skip it and captures rot in a write-only file. |

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] `{phase}-PLAN.md` exists with vertical slices and acceptance criteria
- [ ] `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` captures relevant findings
- [ ] `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` maps tests to requirements
- [ ] Plan passes 8-dimension validation
- [ ] User explicitly approves the plan
