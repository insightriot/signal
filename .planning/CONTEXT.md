# Signal — Fresh-Session Context

Load this at the start of every work session. Short on purpose.

## Project

**Signal** (market-facing: *SignalOS*) — a Claude Code plugin that integrates patterns from the Claude Code plugin ecosystem with a project-complexity calibration router. Command prefix: `/sig:`.

## Scope (locked)

- **v1** = 6-phase MVP (`calibrate → discuss → plan → execute → verify → review → ship` + `escalate`). Currently being built.
- **v2** = 10-phase expansion (adds ideate/validate/strategize upstream + compound downstream). Follow-on, after v1 ships and validates.

See `DECISIONS.md` for full rationale.

## Attribution (locked)

9 source repos in 4 tiers:
- **Ported (v1):** GSD, Agent Skills.
- **Planned (v2):** gstack, pm-skills, superpowers, compound-engineering.
- **Pattern source:** planning-with-files, oh-my-claudecode.
- **Reference:** GSD Skill Creator.

See `LICENSES.md` for details.

## Build approach (locked)

Hand-rolled `.planning/` (this directory) drives the build. **No GSD install.** Once `/sig:calibrate`, `/sig:discuss`, `/sig:plan` are functional (late Tranche 2 / early Tranche 3), switch to dogfooding Signal on itself.

**`.planning/` is always tracked in git** — here and in every user project Signal touches. Never add it to `.gitignore`. It's the project's memory, not scratch state. See `DECISIONS.md` for the full principle.

## Current state

- 7 of 9 slash commands scaffolded (`new-project`, `discuss`, `plan`, `execute`, `verify`, `review`, `ship`). **Missing: `calibrate` and `escalate`.**
- 21 skill files, 17 agent files, 7 reference checklists, 3 tool libs.
- `skills-gsd` → `signal` rebrand **complete** for manifest `name` fields. Repo URLs (`InsightRiot/dev-skills-gsd`) still point at the current GitHub repo name — see OPEN-QUESTIONS.md for the URL rename decision.
- `PROFILE.md` schema not yet written (Tranche 1).
- Tests present but dependencies not installed (Tranche 1).

## Active work

**Tranche 1 — Unblock the build.** See `TRANCHE-1.md`.

## Key files

- `PROJECT.md` — the full v1 spec
- `analysis/SIGNAL-INTEGRATION-RUNDOWN.md` — the v2 vision
- `CLAUDE.md` — project instructions
- `.planning/TRANCHE-{1,2,3,4}.md` — scoped work plans
- `.planning/DECISIONS.md` — append-only architecture decisions
- `.planning/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` — unresolved design questions
- `.planning/STATE.md` — what tranche we're in, active, blocked

## How to start a session

1. Re-read this file (CONTEXT.md) + STATE.md.
2. Read the current tranche file (TRANCHE-{n}.md) for the task list.
3. Glance at OPEN-QUESTIONS.md to see what needs deciding soon.
4. Pick up the first un-checked task.
