# Signal — Project State

Meta-state of the Signal build. Not to be confused with the `.planning/` that Signal's own commands will write in *user* projects once it's functional — this one is for building Signal itself.

## Current Tranche

**Tranche 1 — Unblock the build** (Steps 1–5 of 6 complete; Step 6 = commits, done as we go)

See `TRANCHE-1.md` for the task list.

## Completed

- **Pre-Tranche — Attribution cleanup** (2026-04-22): rewrote `PROJECT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSES.md`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `package.json` to acknowledge all 9 source repos with Ported / Planned / Pattern-source / Reference tiers. Committed.
- **Pre-Tranche — `.planning/` scaffold** (2026-04-22): created this directory; un-ignored `.planning/` in `.gitignore`. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 1 — Manifest rebrand** (2026-04-22): `name` fields changed to `signal` in 4 places. Repo URLs deferred. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 2 — Plugin manifest parts** (2026-04-22): resolved as no-op. Claude Code auto-discovers agents/, skills/, hooks/. References/ is ad-hoc. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 3 — npm install + tests + validator** (2026-04-22): 135 packages, 19 tests passing, validator green. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 4 — Scope formalization** (2026-04-22): added "Scope & Roadmap" section to PROJECT.md; CLAUDE.md forward-looking note updated. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 5 — PROFILE.md schema + tier definitions** (2026-04-22): wrote `references/profile-schema.md` and `references/tier-definitions.md`. Schema locked in DECISIONS.md. Not yet committed (pending).

## Active

Tranche 1 effectively complete after final commit. **Next: Tranche 2, Step 1 — build `/sig:calibrate` against the new schema.**

## Blockers
