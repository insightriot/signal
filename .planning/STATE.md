# Signal — Project State

Meta-state of the Signal build. Not to be confused with the `.planning/` that Signal's own commands will write in *user* projects once it's functional — this one is for building Signal itself.

## Current Tranche

**Tranche 2 — MVP Functional** (Steps 1, 2, 4 of 8 complete)

See `TRANCHE-2.md` for the task list.

## Completed

- **Pre-Tranche — Attribution cleanup** (2026-04-22): rewrote `PROJECT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSES.md`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `package.json` to acknowledge all 9 source repos with Ported / Planned / Pattern-source / Reference tiers. Committed.
- **Pre-Tranche — `.planning/` scaffold** (2026-04-22): created this directory; un-ignored `.planning/` in `.gitignore`. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 1 — Manifest rebrand** (2026-04-22): `name` fields changed to `signal` in 4 places. Repo URLs deferred (initially), then resolved in end-of-session work: GitHub repo renamed `dev-skills-gsd` → `signal`, local remote + all manifest URLs updated. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 2 — Plugin manifest parts** (2026-04-22): resolved as no-op. Claude Code auto-discovers agents/, skills/, hooks/. References/ is ad-hoc. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 3 — npm install + tests + validator** (2026-04-22): 135 packages, 19 tests passing, validator green. Committed (via `tools/validate-plugin.js`).
- **Tranche 1, Step 4 — Scope formalization** (2026-04-22): added "Scope & Roadmap" section to PROJECT.md; CLAUDE.md forward-looking note updated. Committed.
- **Tranche 1, Step 5 — PROFILE.md schema + tier definitions** (2026-04-22): wrote `references/profile-schema.md` and `references/tier-definitions.md`. Schema locked in DECISIONS.md. Committed (`0c5ead6`).
- **Tranche 2, Step 1 — `/sig:calibrate` complete** (2026-04-22 → 2026-04-24): wrote `.claude/commands/sig/calibrate.md` — pre-flight detects 3 scenarios (new project / first calibration / existing PROFILE.md with 4 sub-paths), 5 diagnostic questions with strict enum parsing, tier derivation (FULL / SPIKE / SKETCH / FEATURE), PROFILE.md writer with all 10 rigor_overrides inlined per tier, up/down override handling (downward = warn, upward = brief-confirm with cost implications), `escalation_history` preserved on `--re-calibrate`, anti-rationalization table, gate checklist. Auto-discovered by Claude Code. 19/19 tests pass; validator green. Self-test traced against all 5 scenarios in TRANCHE-2 Step 1.

  Surrounding design decisions logged: `FUTURE-IDEAS.md` (new — calibration granularity options A/B/C with C as the lean; multi-feature project lifecycle), `TRANCHE-3.md` (promoted `/sig:status` + `/sig:resume` to committed Task 1), `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` (logged Socratic question-pattern codification, resolve before T2 Step 3).

- **Tranche 2, Step 2 — `/sig:escalate` complete** (2026-04-24): wrote `.claude/commands/sig/escalate.md` — pre-flight requires existing PROFILE.md, re-asks 5 questions with prior answers as defaults, derives new tier with same rules, three-case comparison (same/escalation-up/de-escalation), backfill warnings table (5 rows including Nyquist permanent-gap row), appends to `escalation_history` (preserves `created_at` and `created_by`), markdown body section per escalation. **All 9 sig commands now exist on disk.** Tests 19/19, validator green, auto-discovered.

  Architectural insight surfaced: **strict Nyquist is a one-way ratchet — only forward work can achieve it; pre-escalation commits hold permanent quality gaps that no command can recover.** Documented in `references/tier-definitions.md` (new "Recoverable vs. permanent backfills" subsection) and surfaced in `escalate.md`'s Nyquist backfill warning. Reinforces why `/sig:calibrate`'s 5 questions matter — under-tiering creates irrecoverable cost, not just deferrable work.

- **Tranche 2, Step 4 — state.js + profile helpers** (2026-04-24): added `CALIBRATE` to `PHASES` in `tools/lib/state.js`. New `tools/lib/profile.js` exports `readProfile(baseDir)` (parses + strict-validates `.planning/PROFILE.md` frontmatter against the schema in `references/profile-schema.md`; throws `ProfileSchemaError` on any violation), `isPhaseEnabled(profile, phaseName)` (CALIBRATE always true, otherwise checks `phases_skipped`), and `applyRigorOverrides(config, profile)` (returns a new merged config with `rigor_overrides` attached + obvious legacy-key correspondences for `workflow.*`, `gates.*`, `parallelization.max_concurrent_agents`; non-mutating). Added `yaml@^2.8.3` as a runtime dependency (real parser since `escalation_history` carries nested arrays of objects with quoted strings). 28 new tests in `tests/profile.test.js`. Total 47/47 passing, validator green.

## Active

**Next: Tranche 2, Step 5 — naming/bindings drift + validator updates.** Includes adding `calibrate.md` and `escalate.md` to `validate-plugin.js` REQUIRED_COMMANDS, adding `references/profile-schema.md` and `references/tier-definitions.md` to REQUIRED_FILES, the orphan-skill audit, and `testing-patterns.md` vs. `testing-checklist.md` reconciliation.

Step 3 (the "read PROFILE.md first" preamble pass on the 6 phase commands) remains blocked on the Socratic-pattern OPEN-QUESTION. Now that `readProfile` / `isPhaseEnabled` / `applyRigorOverrides` exist, Step 3 has its tools — only the question-pattern decision is still pending.

## Blockers

None for Step 5. Step 3 blocked on resolving the Socratic-pattern OPEN-QUESTION (top entry in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`) — needs `references/question-patterns.md` written + decision on the 3+other convention before the preamble pass touches the 6 phase commands.
